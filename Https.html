    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>

    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are the rules or standards that allow computers to communicate over the internet or a network.
        They help in transferring data from one device to another smoothly. Some common examples of internet protocols include 
        <b>HTTP</b> (used for web pages), <b>HTTPS</b> (secure web pages), <b>FTP</b> (for file transfer), 
        <b>TCP/IP</b> (main protocol for the internet), and <b>SMTP</b> (used to send emails).
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

    <p>
        <b>IP addresses</b> are unique numbers assigned to each device connected to a network. 
        They help to identify and locate the device online or in a local network. <br><br>

        The two main versions of IP addresses are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>IPv4</b>: This is the older version and looks like this: 192.168.0.1</li>
            <li><b>IPv6</b>: This is the newer version and looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</li>
        </ul>

        The <b>difference</b> between them is that IPv6 can provide more addresses than IPv4, which is useful as more devices connect to the internet. <br><br>

        <b>Real-world applications</b> of IP addresses include identifying your device when you browse websites, use apps, or connect to Wi-Fi.
